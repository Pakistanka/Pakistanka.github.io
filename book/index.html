						<p>
							When I think about my travel life, I recall all the food and drinks which I have tasted before.
						</p>
						<p>
							The taste of meals was various and depended on the year season and weather: <a href="#">spice lentil soup with lemon</a> in Alexandria, mouth watering Pakistani <a href="#">sweets</a> and calefactory and "up energy" Montenegro <a href="#">tea with ginger, lemon and honey</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							So you can understand why I am eager to gather fresh recipes from anywhere. In addition, these formulas are new for us, not for local people.
						</p>
						<p>
							The follow-up conversations and friendships have highlighted the misunderstandings in percepion of food and its role in the culture of the peoples. Food which we get used to feed our hunger has a pivotal role in enhance the status and influence.
						</p>
						<p>
							Only last year I strated visiting more common countries, such as Italy, the Chech Republic, whose cuisine is widespread all over the world. Before it my way were far away of these places.

								My travels allowed me to collect a huge number of food recipes all over the world. At first sight they may seem unusual and hard to prepare, however, it's only the first impression. 
						</p>
						<p>
								Here are repices from: Cameroon, Pakistan, Tunisia, Russia, Montenegro, Italy and other countries. You can choose any of them at the special chapters dealing with type of cuisine:

								<li>
									<mark class="orange">Salats <em>(Hot and cold salats)</em>.
								</li>

								</li>
								<li>
									<mark class="orange">Soups</mark>
								</li>
								<li>
									<mark class="orange">Vegan course</mark>
								</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							I was trying to collect whatever I found, because most of these recipes are were not published and were transmitted from nothers to daughters during the centuries.
						</p>
						<p>
							It may seems that some ingredients are unlogical and can ruin the taste of meal, but you will be surprised how they combine and fit each other.
